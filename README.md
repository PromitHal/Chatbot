In these project,Natural Processing Techniques have been used to create basic chatbots. The intents and possible responses have been stored in a JSON file and the chatbot was trained on these JSON file using Long Short Term Memory Networks(LSTMS) using Keras API in Python.
The first chatbot acceps keyboard input from the user and responds with a voice. The second chatbot is capable of accepting input as voice which is converted into text via speech recognition module in python.
The chatbots here are very basic and functionality is limited. However an increase in the the training corpus can help increase its performance.
